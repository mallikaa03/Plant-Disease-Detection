# Potato Plant Disease Classification

This model helps in detecting different conditions of a potato plant leaf, mainly: Early Blight and Late Blight conditions. 
Here I take images of potato plant which is affected by the disease Potato-Early_blight and Potato-Late_blight and train it on custom CNN model. This system could help farmers in determining which disease is affecting their crop and hence prevent them from facing huge losses.


## Model Performance
The CNN model gave an accuracy of 98.44%

The final output of the model is the Leaf condition and the confidence.
